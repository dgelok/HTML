    <h2>What is Ska?</h2>
    <p class="explain">It's 1997, so clearly the following wasn't copied and pasted from Wikipedia:
        <br>
        <br>
        Ska (/skɑː/; Jamaican: [skjæ]) is a music genre that originated in 
        Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. It 
        combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm 
        and blues. Ska is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on 
        the off beat. It was developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement 
        "Coxsone" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm and 
        blues and then began recording their own songs. In the early 1960s, ska was the 
        dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became 
        popular with many skinheads.

        <br>
        Music historians typically divide the history of ska into three periods: the 
        original Jamaican scene of the 1960s; the 2 Tone ska revival of the late 1970s in 
        Britain, which fused Jamaican ska rhythms and melodies with the faster tempos and 
        harder edge of punk rock forming ska-punk; and third wave ska, which involved 
        bands from a wide range of countries around the world, in the late 1980s and 1990s.
